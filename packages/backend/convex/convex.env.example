# Convex environment variables (example)
# Convex reads environment variables from its deployment, not from files.
# Use the Convex CLI to set these values:
#   npx convex env set CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN "https://<your_clerk_issuer_domain>"
# Optionally set AI keys and other secrets in Convex as well.
#   npx convex env set GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Reference only; not read by Convex directly.
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN="https://<your_clerk_issuer_domain>"
